;;; CONFIGURATION
;;;

; It's a bit tricky to pick good defaults for the size and placement defaults
; for angle markings. For one using a thicker line requires more space between
; lines. This matters because there is a difference between bitmaps, svg and pdfs.
; For now, let's rely on parameters.

(define angle-radius  (make-parameter 0.7)) ; distance along left leg
(define angle-spacing (make-parameter 0.1)) ; distance between arcs
(define mark-size     (make-parameter 0.3)) ; size of straight mark
(define mark-spacing  (make-parameter 0.2)) ; space between side marks

;;; Automatic configuration

; Eventually the above configuration ought to be computed on the bases of the
; penwidth. The following functions aren't used now - but can be come in handy
; in the future.

; The actual penwidth isn't know until the pict is drawn, so we need some trickery:

(define (get-current-pen)
  ; This creates a fake pict, draw sets up the pen, and then we grab it.
  (let/ec return (draw (unsafe-dc (λ (dc dx dy) (return (send dc get-pen))) 1 1))))

(define (get-line-width [pen (get-current-pen)])  
  (send pen get-width))

(define (mm x) (* 2.83465 x)) ; mm to pt

; angle-radius : [pen] -> number
#;(define (angle-radius [pen (get-current-pen)])
    (+ (px (mm 8))
       (* angle-radius-factor
          (sqrt (get-line-width pen)))))

#;(define (angle-space [pen (get-current-pen)])
    (* angle-space-factor
       (sqrt (get-line-width pen))))

;;;
