@; ----------------------------------------

A Bezier curve from point @racket[A] to point @racket[B] with
control points @racket[A+] and @racket[B-] is represented as
an instance of a @racket[bez] structure: @racket[(bez A A+ B- B)].

Graphically such a curve begins at point @racket[A] and ends at point @racket[B].
The curve leaves point @racket[A] directed towards 
the control point @racket[A+]. The direction in which the curve enters the
end point @racket[B] is from @racket[B-]. 

The points @racket[A] and @racket[B] are referred to as start and end point 
of the Bezier curve. The points @racket[A+] and @racket[B-] are refererred
to as control points. The point @racket[A+] is the post control of @racket[A]
and the point @racket[B-] is the pre control of @racket[B].

Most users will not have a reason to work with @racket[bez] structures directly.
The @racket[curve] constructor is intended to cover all use cases.

Each point on the Bezier curve corresponds to a real number @math{t} between 0 and 1.
The correspondence is called a @math{parameterization} of the curve. The number @math{t}
is called a @math{parameter}. Thus for each value of the parameter @math{t} between 0 and 1,
you get a point on the curve. The parameter value @math{t=0} corresponds to the start 
point @racket[A] and the parameter value @math{t=1} corresponds to the end point.

Let's see an example of a Bezier curve and its construction.

parameterization.
