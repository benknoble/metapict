The function @racket[make-color*] is a fault tolerant version of @racket[make-color]
that also accepts color names.
                                                                         
Given a color name as a string, @racket[make-color*] returns a @racket[color%] object.

Given real numbers to use as the color components, @racket[make-color*] works
like @racket[make-color], but accepts both non-integer numbers, and 
numbers outside the range 0--255. For a real number @racket[x], the value
used is @racket[(min 255 (max 0 (exact-floor x)))].

The optional argument @racket[α] is the transparency. The default value is 1.
Given a transparency outside the interval 0--1, whichever value of 0 and 1 is
closest to @racket[α] is used.}
