@defmodule[metapict/trans]

@; ----------------------------------------

Given a curve @math{c}, one can use a transformation to calculate a new curve @math{c'}
with a different shape or placement. Transformations such as scaling, reflection, 
rotation and translation appear again and again in graphics programs. These transformations 
are all @emph{affine transformations}. An important property of affine transformations is 
that the composition of two affine transformations is a new affine transformation.
If a series of transformations are to be applied to a large set of points or curves,
it is more efficient to compute the composed transformation first, and then apply that
to the large set.

In MetaPict a transformation can be applied to instances of @racket[curve], @racket[pt], 
@racket[vec] and @racket[bez]. Furthermore a transformation can be applied to another transformation.

Mathematically an affine transformation transforms a point @math{(x,y)} into the point

@centered{
@math{x' = ax + cy + e} @linebreak[]
@math{y' = bx + dy + f}}

where a, b, c, d, e and f are real numbers.


@defstruct[trans ([a real?] [b real?] [c real?] [d real?] [e real?] [f real?])]{
The structure @racket[trans] represents the affine transformation:

@centered{
@math{x' = ax + cy + e} @linebreak[]
@math{y' = bx + dy + f}}

The @racket[trans] struct is applicable and can be applied to 
instances of @racket[curve], @racket[pt], @racket[vec] and @racket[bez].
Also a @racket[trans] can be applied to another @racket[trans].

The most used transformations have specialized constructors (see below),
so @racket[trans] is seldom used directly.

Note: (1,0) zscaled (a,b) = (a,b) , thus (1,0) is rotated and 
scaled into (a,b). Think of zscaled as ``complex multiplaction''.

In the example, the red curve is multiplied with @math{0+1i}, which
corresponds to a rotation of 90 degrees.

In the example, the blue curve is multiplied with @math{1+1i}, which
corresponds to a rotation of 45 degrees. Also, since the
magnitude of @math{1+1i} is @math{sqrt(2)}, the figure is scaled by
the factor @math{sqrt(2)}.
